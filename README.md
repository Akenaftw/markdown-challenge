####You Can Always Count On Me to...
Turn that frown upside down! Huge fan of top notch banter. I am a very optimistic person, and I love to bring and enjoy a good team vibe.
I like helping people solving issues of all sorts, because a group that doesn't face problems will run into bigger ones along the road.
#####A funny story
4 years ago I fell off of a ginny, a platform, and hung at 10 meters height in my climbing gear for 20 minutes until my colleagues came back from their coffee break. At first I was yelling for help, but afterwards I gave in and decided to just hang back and relax.
######TL;DR
Climbing gear will wreck your nuts after 20 minutes.
